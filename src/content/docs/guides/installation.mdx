#### **Prerequisites**

While you do not need to install every software used within `nf-pediatric`, there is two core dependencies that need to be available at runtime: 


<Steps>

1. **Nextflow (>= 24.10.5)**

   To install the `nextflow` executable, please refer to the [official `nextflow` documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html). While `nf-pediatric` has a minimal `nextflow` version, it is always tested against the latest version available (and oldest), so you can go ahead and install the latest version available. If you plan on running the pipeline on an HPC server, you might want to validate it is not already installed by your server's admins.

   **To validate `nextflow` is installed, you can run the following command:**

   <CommandOutputs>
   <span slot="command">
   ```bash
   nextflow run helloworld
   ```
   </span>
   <span slot="output">
   Check the command's output, you've been greeted in 4 different languages
   (english, french, italian, spanish) !

   ```bash
   N E X T F L O W   ~  version 24.10.4

   Pulling nextflow-io/helloworld ...

   Bonjour world!

   Hello world!

   Ciao world!

   Hola world!
   ```
   </span>
   </CommandOutputs>

2. **Docker OR Apptainer**

   In order to avoid users installing all software dependencies used within `nf-pediatric`, the pipeline relies on containers for all processing steps. Those containers can be run using two technologies: **Docker** or **Apptainer**. 

   <Steps>

    1. **Docker**

        When available, the pipeline should be used with Docker. It works on all OS systems, and can be installed following the [official documentation](https://www.docker.com/get-started/). On HPC servers, for example, Docker is often not allowed or supported, in this case, you should refer to the Apptainer section.

        **To validate Docker is installed and available, you can run the following command:**

        <CommandOutputs>
        <span slot="command">
        ```bash
        docker run hello-world
        ```
        </span>
        <span slot="output">
        ```
        Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
        latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
        e6590344b1a5: Pull complete 
        Digest: sha256:bfbb0cc14f13f9ed1ae86abc2b9f11181dc50d779807ed3a3c5e55a6936dbdd5
        Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

        Hello from Docker!

        This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
        To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
        1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
        2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
            (amd64)
        3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
            executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
        4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
            to your terminal.
        To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:

        $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

        ```
        </span>
        </CommandOutputs>

    2. **Apptainer**

        Apptainer (previously singularity) is an alternative container system to Docker that works solely (for now) on Linux. On HPC servers, this will the container system that will mostly be used (often times already installed by the server's admins). If you need to install it, please refer to the [official documentation](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/quick_start.html#installation).

        **To validate Apptainer is installed and accessible, you can run the following command:**

        <CommandOutputs>
        <span slot="command">
        ```bash
        apptainer --help
        ```
        </span>
        <span slot="output">
        ```
        Linux container platform optimized for High Performance Computing (HPC) and
        Enterprise Performance Computing (EPC)

        Usage:
        apptainer [global options...]

        Description:
        Apptainer containers provide an application virtualization layer enabling
        mobility of compute via both application and environment portability. With
        Apptainer one is capable of building a root file system that runs on any
        other Linux system where Apptainer is installed.

        Options:
            --build-config    use configuration needed for building containers
        -c, --config string   specify a configuration file (for root or

                                "/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/Core/apptainer/1.2.4/etc/apptainer/apptainer.conf")
        -d, --debug           print debugging information (highest verbosity)
        -h, --help            help for apptainer
            --nocolor         print without color output (default False)
        -q, --quiet           suppress normal output
        -s, --silent          only print errors
        -v, --verbose         print additional information
